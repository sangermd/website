    The prevalence of construction and demolition (C&D) waste and the concurrent demand for construction aggregate presents the opportunity to recycle C&D waste materials as substitutes for virgin aggregate. Commonly, recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) is used as base course in pavement construction. Environmentally responsible applications of RCA must consider the high pH leachate and trace element leaching risks reported in the literature. This review presents the methodology, results, and limitations of existing laboratory and field investigations of RCA leachate chemistry. Long-term highway field studies of RCA leachate illustrate that an initially high leachate pH approaches neutral within approximately one to two years of construction. Conversely, laboratory investigations of RCA leachate pH using batch reactor leaching tests and column leaching tests measure consistently high leachate pH (pH > 10). The discrepancies between field and laboratory measurements of RCA leachate pH suggest that the current laboratory methodology inadequately describes leachate conditions in the field. The authors recommend that future laboratory investigations consider intermittent wetting and drying cycles, eliminate particle abrasion, employ relevant contact times, and consider additional environmental processes that reduce leachate pH such as soil acidity and carbonation.
